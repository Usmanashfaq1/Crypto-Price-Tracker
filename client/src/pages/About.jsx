          Hey! ðŸ‘‹ I'm <span className="font-semibold text-pink-500">Usman</span>
          , a passionate and curious software developer with a strong interest
          in building web applications that are fast, accessible, and beautiful.
          I specialize in the JavaScript ecosystem â€” particularly React,
          Node.js, and Express â€” and I'm constantly learning to improve my
          skills.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
          My journey started with a love for solving problems and creating
          things that people can use. Whether it's frontend design or backend
          logic, I enjoy making ideas come to life on the web.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
          Outside of coding, I play soccer daily ðŸ¥…âš½, dive into badminton for
          fun, and enjoy exploring nature with my family. I'm also focused on
          personal growth â€” becoming more disciplined, mindful, and consistent.
